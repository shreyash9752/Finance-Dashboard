Finance Dashboard for JS Bank üíº

This project involved creating an interactive **Finance Dashboard** using Power BI to help JS Bank track key financial metrics and gain deeper insights into their customer base. The dashboard provided a comprehensive view of the bank's operations and performance, allowing leadership to make data-driven decisions. Key features of the dashboard included:

- **Customer Demographics Analysis**: Visualized data on the total number of customers across different countries, breaking it down by age, gender, and geographic region üåç. This helped the bank identify key customer segments for personalized marketing strategies.
- **Customer Balance Overview**: Displayed the distribution of account balances across customers, highlighting high-value accounts and trends in customer savings or expenditures.
- **Gender-Based Analysis**: Compared the number of male and female customers and analyzed their behavior patterns, providing insights into customer engagement and financial product usage by gender.
- **Trend Tracking and Performance Metrics**: The dashboard provided real-time updates on financial performance metrics, including deposit growth, loan balances, and customer acquisition rates üìä.

The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly, with interactive filters allowing users to explore data based on various dimensions. This project showcased my ability to clean, process, and visualize data in Power BI, resulting in a tool that empowered JS Bank's decision-makers to monitor performance and identify growth opportunities.
